/*
Package responder provides a means of prompting for values and reading from
the terminal. The terminal device will be put into a raw mode so that you can
read single characters. The package offers a standard help feature and allows
the caller to specify default values for the prompted value. The value
entered will be checked against the list of valid entries.
